    usage: json2dcm [<options>] [-i <dicom-file>] -j <json-file> [-o
                    <dicom-file>]
    
    Convert <json-file> (or the standard input if <json-file> = '-') into a
    DICOM stream written to -o <dicom-file> or standard output if no -o option
    is specified. Optionally load DICOM file specified by -i <dicom-file> and
    merge attributes parsed from <json-file> with it.

    Options:
     -B,--no-bulkdata                do not read bulkdata from -i <dicom-file>
     -b,--alloc-bulkdata             load bulkdata from -i <dicom-file> into
                                     memory; at default, bulkdata from -i
                                     <dicom-file> is streamed to -o
                                     <dicom-file> and not hold in memory
        --blk <[seq/]attr>           specify attribute by keyword or tag value

                                     bulkdata, e.g.

                                     --blk=00880200/7FE00010. Multiple
                                     attributes can be specified by repeating
                                     the option for each attribute.

                                     for attributes with particular VRs which
                                     shall be treated as bulkdata, e.g.:
